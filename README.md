## Categories
**Tools and Services.** Are you a web developer interested in building tools that make the protocol easier to interact with? Are you interested in increasing decentralization, data resiliency, and data portability? Can you build tools and services that make it easier for miners, developers, and tokenholders to interact with STX?

**Core Protocol Development.** Are you a blockchain developer or computer science researcher? **** Build core infrastructure that helps progress a user-owned internet. Examples: alternate implementations, contributions to stacks-blockchain reference implementation, etc.

**Wish list or Wildcard.** Ready to contribute but not sure were to start? We're crowdsourcing ideas from across our ecosystem that best serve our mission. Check out our wish list for ideas or create your own proposal for a project you believe will add value to the ecosystem and explain why.

## Grants Application
Grant applications should clearly outline the project's purpose, who benefits, how the project will serve the mission, a measurable outcome, relevant experience from the individual/team, risks, and links to community input, research, or supporting work relevant to your project.

The grants proposal process was designed with input from the community. Applications are a part of the conversation with the STX ecosystem to seek feedback, input and collaborators. Applicants may benefit from presenting their idea in a blog post, video demo, or forum discussion to get more input and feedback. We strongly encourage applicants to consider how to continue sharing proposal updates, progress, and final deliverables with the community over time.
